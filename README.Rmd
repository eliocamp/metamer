Implements the algorithm proposed by [Matejka & Fitzmaurice (2017)](https://www.autodesk.com/research/publications/same-stats-different-graphs) to create metamers (datasets with identical statistical properties but very different graphs) with an annealing scheme derived from [de Vicente et al. (2003)](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0375960103013653?via%3Dihub).

In colour theory, [metamers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metamerism_(color)) are colours that have very different wavelength distribution but are perceived as equal by out visual system. This happens because out eyes essentially summarise a continuous distribution of wavelength by just 3 numbers: the amount that each type of cone cell is exited. Colour metamerism is how artists can reproduce so many colours with a few pigments, or how PC monitors use only 3 lights to show colourful pictures.

Statistical transformations such as mean, standard deviation and correlation behave very similarly in that they summarise data with just a few numbers for the benefit of our limited cognitive capacity. Thus, statistical metamers are sets of data that share some statistical properties. 

[This article](https://eliocamp.github.io/codigo-r/en/2019/01/statistical-metamerism/) explores statistical metamerism in more detail. 

## Installation

You can install metamer with:

```r
install.packages("metamer")
```

or install the development version with:

``` r
# install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("eliocamp/metamer")
```

## Example

You can construct metamers from a starting dataset and a vector of statistical properties to remain constant (by default, up to 2 significant figures). 

```{r example}
library(metamer)
# Start with the datasaurus
# install.packages("datasauRus")
dino <- subset(datasauRus::datasaurus_dozen, dataset == "dino")
dino$dataset <- NULL

# And we want to preserve means and correlation
mean_cor <- delayed_with(mean(x), mean(y), cor(x, y)) 

set.seed(42) # To make results reproducible
metamers <- metamerise(dino, preserve = mean_cor, 
                       stop_if = n_metamers(300), 
                       perturbation = 1,
                       keep = 19)
print(metamers)
```

We found `r length(metamers$metamers)` metamers. Let's see the final one, with the starting dataset as background. 

```{r}
library(ggplot2)

ggplot(tail(metamers), aes(x, y)) +
  geom_point(data = dino, color = "red", alpha = 0.5, size = 0.4) +
  geom_point()
```

We can check that the statistical properties have been preserved up to 2 significant figures:

```{r}
cbind(dino = signif(mean_cor(dino), 2),
      last = signif(mean_cor(tail(metamers)), 2))
```

However, a semi random cloud of points is not that interesting, so we can specify a minimizing function so that the result is similar to another dataset. `metamerise` will start from the last metamer of the previous run if the `data` argument is a list of metamers and append the result. 

```{r}
x_shape <- subset(datasauRus::datasaurus_dozen, dataset == "x_shape")
x_shape$dataset <- NULL
```

```{r}
metamers <- metamerise(dino, 
                       preserve = mean_cor,
                       minimize = mean_dist_to(x_shape),
                       stop_if = minimize_ratio(0.02),
                       keep = 99)
```

Now the result is a bit more impressive. 

```{r}
ggplot(tail(metamers), aes(x, y)) +
  geom_point(data = dino, color = "red", alpha = 0.5, size = 0.4) +
  geom_point()
```

We can animate the whole thing. 

```{r, gganimate = list(fps = 30)}
library(gganimate)

ggplot(metamers, aes(x, y)) +
  geom_point() +
  transition_manual(.metamer)
```

You can freehand your own starting or target data with the `draw_data()` utility, that will open a shiny interface. You might need to install `shiny` and `miniUI` with `install.packages(c("shiny", "miniUI"))`.

Metamerizing operations can be chained while changing the minimizing function. 

```{r}

star <- subset(datasauRus::datasaurus_dozen, dataset == "star")
star$dataset <- NULL
set.seed(42)
metamers <- metamerise(dino,
                       preserve = mean_cor, 
                       minimize = mean_dist_to(x_shape),
                       stop_if = minimize_ratio(0.05),
                       keep = 29) |> 
  set_minimize(mean_dist_to(star)) |> 
  metamerise(stop_if =  minimize_ratio(0.05),
             keep = 30) |> 
  set_minimize(mean_dist_to(dino)) |> 
  metamerise(stop_if =  minimize_ratio(0.05), 
             keep = 30) 
```

And the full sequence 

```{r, gganimate = list(nframes = 30*3, fps = 30)}
ggplot(metamers, aes(x, y)) +
  geom_point() +
  transition_manual(.metamer)
```
