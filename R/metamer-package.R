#' @section Overview:
#' Create metamers with the [metamerize()] function.
#'
#' Some helper functions included:
#' * [draw_data()] fordrawing 2D datasets by hand.
#'
#' * [delayed_with()] for defining statistics to preserve.
#'
#' * [moments_n()] for preserving moments of order n.
#'
#' * [mean_dist_to()] for minimizing the mean distance to a known target dataset.
#'
#' * [trim()] for keeping only some metamers.
#'
#' The [as.data.frame()] method included will turn a `metamer_list` into a tidy
#' data.frame.

#' Inspired by Matejka & Fitzmaurice (2017) awesome paper.
